[1, 5], [10, 20], [1, 6], [16, 19], [5, 11] = 19
1,5 overlaps 1,6 overlaps 5,11 = 1,11 (10)
1,2,3,4 + 1,2,3,4,5 + 5,6,7,8,9,10
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 = 10
10,20 overlaps 16,19 = 10,20 BUT 10 was already included in the previous interval so 11,20 (9)
10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19 + 16,17,18,19 = 10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 + 10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19 = 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19 (19)

looking at 1,5
looking at 10,20 in relation to 1,5
1 < 10 && 1 < 20 && 5 < 10 && 5 < 20 = no overlap

moving y right by 1
looking at 1,6 in relation to 1,5
1 = 1 && 5 < 6 = overlap
1,6 = 1,2,3,4,5 = 5 added to sum

moving y right by 1
looking at 16,19 in relation to 1,5
16 > 1 && 19 > 5                     IF X0 IS > Y1 THEN X1 IS ALSO MORE THAN Y1 / IF Y1 > X1

looking at 10,20
looking at 1,6 in relation to 10,20
10 > 1 && 10 > 6 && 20 > 1 && 20 > 6 = no overlap

10,20 = 20-10 = 10 added to sum


ADD THE ENTIRE INTERVAL FROM LOW TO HIGH, INCLUDING EVERY DIGIT AND THEN WHEN i GO TO ADD THE NEXT ONE, GET EVERY DIGIT BUT ONLY ADD THE ONES THT DON'T ALREADY EXIT IN THE ARRAY
AND THEN ADD TOGETHER ALL OF THE ENTRIES IN THE ARRAY IN THE END TO GET THE SUM TOTAL
